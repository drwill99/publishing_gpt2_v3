<doyle> The world seemed like such a peaceful place until the magic tree was discovered in London. There will never be another, that. What is it going on? What are people like in other places with no known magic? It's like a new World, one that's completely unshakable and never going to end. People around London know the power that it seems to give away what's in front and center of the world. It has a really different look. Something from outside the normal is happening. Some normal are being that people know is magic, magic that we all know as it were born of such creatures as the magician the black snake. They see the curse and the one they see is something they're not allowed to know. This is the part that the witch in the woods in Brighton looks at the map. She's talking to her sister and sister tell her brother who told her about the man that did this and that story. Her sister went out there and went with the girl, to get information. she heard the story, and was in her home. Af
